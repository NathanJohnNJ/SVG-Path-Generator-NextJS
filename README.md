# SVG-Path-Generator-NextJS

###To Do List
- [ ] Check all mentions of PathContext have been removed.
- [ ] Finish adding the Valtio path to the Edit Path page.
- [ ] Figure out how to properly implement localStorage or similar to ensure path state is maintained upon refresh.
- [ ] Make grid adaptable to different sized paths - needs to auto detect how big it needs to be from the path provided, and as the path changes. This means updating viewBox as well as height and width appropriately.
- [ ] Finish RainbowButton animations.
- [ ] Implement more small animations to improve styling (& knowledge).
- [ ] Add other commands to the command panel (from lines and curves).
- [ ] Add Z command.
- [ ] Research and add A command. 
- [ ] Removeall unnecessary code and files.
- [ ] Remove console.log() code.
